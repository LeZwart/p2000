# P2000 p2kflex HDB Scraper

A webscraper that gathers information about P2000, the Dutch public emergency service communications system.

## P2000

P2000 is part of the C2000 network used by emergency services in the Netherlands. It is primarily used for paging messages to first responders. Messages usually consist of capcodes (which pagers are to be alerted)

Unlike C2000 which is encrypted, P2000 is publicly accessible, and several websites display real-time P2000 messages. This project focuses on scraping p2kflex.nl and storing that information for further analysis or integration into other systems.
